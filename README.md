# App's Conception
This app was developed individually by me as my capstone project for York Solution's Barriers to Entry program.
I had two weeks to design and build both the front and back end. 

# App's Intent
This app is a Pantry Inventory tracker that allows users to create and edit accounts, add items to the pantry, and 
create recipes using the items in the pantry.

# App Tech-Stack
The app is built using an Angular front-end and a Java Spring Boot backend that is built off of the Java persistence api. 

I've added separate READMEs in each of the folders if you'd like to run the app locally.

# Run App
1. Ensure docker is installed on your device and the engine is running.
1. Navigate to /db folder.
2. Delete /data folder if it exists.
3. In terminal:
    > docker-compose down
4. In terminal:
    > docker-compose up
5. Once complete, go to localhost:4200 to see the app!
